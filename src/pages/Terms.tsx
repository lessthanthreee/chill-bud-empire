            <p>
              All products sold on our website are intended for legal use in accordance with local, state, and federal laws. Our products contain delta-8 THC, which is a cannabinoid derived from hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp and hemp derivatives at the federal level, but delta-8 THC's legal status varies by state.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              It is your responsibility to determine whether delta-8 THC is legal in your jurisdiction before making a purchase. Cleveland Cartridge Co. makes no guarantees about the legality of our products in your jurisdiction and will not be held responsible for any legal issues that arise from purchasing or using our products where delta-8 THC is restricted or prohibited.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Our products may cause intoxication and impairment. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while using our products. Keep out of reach of children and pets.
