# Backend Setup and Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the final setup and configuration for the Cleveland Cartridge Co. e-commerce application. The application uses Supabase for database storage and edge functions for server-side operations.

## 1. Database Structure

### Current Tables
- `products`: Stores product information (we only have 1 product)
- `orders`: Stores customer orders
- `order_items`: Stores items within orders

## 2. Backend Setup

### 2.1 Application Structure
- The project uses React Router with a single Router in main.tsx
- CartProvider manages the shopping cart state

### 2.2 Order Processing Flow
1. User adds the product to cart
2. User provides shipping information
3. User selects a cryptocurrency payment method
4. User submits order
5. System creates order record in database
6. System creates order items in database
7. System logs the order for review

## 3. Testing Plan

### 3.1 Testing Checklist

#### Database Operations
- Create a test order with valid data
- Verify order creation in the Supabase database
- Verify order items are created properly
- Check edge function logs for successful order processing

### 3.2 Order Testing Steps

1. **Add Product to Cart**
   - Visit the product page
   - Click "Add to Cart"
   - Verify the product appears in the cart sidebar

2. **Complete Checkout Process**
   - Fill in shipping information with valid data
   - Select a cryptocurrency payment method
   - Submit the order
   - Verify success toast message appears

3. **Verify Data in Supabase**
   - Check the orders table in Supabase for the new order
   - Check the order_items table for the corresponding items
   - Verify all fields contain the expected data

4. **Check Logs**
   - Verify edge function logs show successful order processing
   - Check for any errors or warnings

## 4. Common Issues and Solutions

### 4.1 Router Configuration
- Issue: Multiple Router components causing errors
- Solution: Ensure BrowserRouter is only used once in the application (main.tsx)

### 4.2 Order Processing
- Issue: Orders not appearing in database
- Solution: Check for proper UUID generation and database insertion

## 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

- Review Supabase logs regularly by visiting the Supabase dashboard
